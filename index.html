Hi.

It has been an immense privilege to collaborate with you and work for Microsoft. 
Privilege. Yes, I am using this specific word, privilege, because I had the opportunity to meet and work with you, travel around the World, influence our society, and experience the best with the best professionals in the World. 

Each of you has the same privilege and the opportunity to influence our society and communities.
To transform and inspire business, not only digitally, but by making human connections and impacting lives everywhere.
New versions of technologies will replace the old ones, but links and relationships will remain for a long, long time. Working at Microsoft is a privilege as it is also a great power. 
I can use the ancient allusion to the Sword of Damocles to tell you, "With great power comes great responsibility"… ok, ok… Yes, also "Spider-Man" movie, but I like to connect it with Shakespeare's Henry IV: "…Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.". 
Just think about it. 
I did great things during my tenure but also did wrong, too, as it is not easy to balance all tasks, family, life, demands, urgencies, pandemics, and wars. 
All this matters and impacts you and me. 

Responsibility and power also imply a personal cost to everyone. So, use the power and the crown you have today to make a dent in the World. 
Making this mark is not an easy job, and it does not need to be a competition, but, in the long run, you should be a better version of yourself, and for that, the World will be better. 
I made my dent, delivering several projects around the World, but one was truly special: 
CETS.
A project sponsored by Bill Gates, which started from a direct e-mail request from a Canadian Detective Sergeant to Bill Gates, spread to several countries, including Interpol and other agencies around the World, and still impacts the lives of exploited children even 18 years after the 1st version.
I am proud of being CETS's original team member, a project that helped create the basis for a global solution that enables collaboration among nations and agencies. 
That project made the World and me better.

You can also make a better Microsoft (I am counting on it, as I am still a shareholder!). Use your shareholder vote to drive your vision and the change you want. 
You have the power. Use it. Every year I exercise my vote. Why shouldn’t you?

But again, this is not a competition.
So, on the professional side, keep supporting your peers, your managers, leaders, and your customers. Give all of them a chance to do better, and they may surprise you.

Now, about you. 
In your personal life, do not give up your privacy so quickly just because you want something for free. 
It is not free at all, and privacy is one of the most basic social rights. 
Embrace the differences and the minorities. Give voice to those who are oppressed and silenced. Evaluate the risks every minute. 
If you have time, take the risk, as you will probably recover later. 
Enjoy the good moments and learn from the bad ones. 
Never be shy or choose silence when you don't agree, but respect and listen to others' opinions. This is the first step toward reaching a win-win agreement. 
Hug your children tight tonight. 
Recycle, or better, Re-use or Re-purpose first, then recycle. Recycling is perfect, but it also consumes a lot of resources to transform. Re-purposing should be your first option. 
Ride a bicycle. If I can ride long distances, you can do much more. I'm planning to bike the "The Great Divide Trail" next year. I am looking for partners. Let me know. 

I am not sure where the path ahead will take me. 
Yes, uncertainty is a bag of mixed feelings. 
If you are in the same boat, if you need any help, don't hesitate to get in touch with me! 
The road might seem to be tortuous and dark, but we do not need to complete it alone. 
Let us share experiences, insights, and support. Together we will cross this transition phase. 

I may finally have enough time to complete my two books and I hope you enjoy it soon. Who knows what the future holds, right?

I want to close this phase with a personal thought: 

The easiest thing to waste is time. You only need to do nothing. The hardest thing to obtain is also time, as you cannot recover any of your wasted past time. So keep moving towards your dreams and aspirations, one step at a time, every day. I am sure you will arrive on time. 

Thank you all and see you soon!
Yuji
